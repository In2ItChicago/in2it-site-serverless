				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>We are a group of Chicagoans who believe civic engagement matters, and want to remove barriers people face getting involved. IN2IT was created to gather events scattered across the internet, and give people the tools to quickly and easily find what pairs best with their interests, schedule, and skills. Our aim is to help people like you spend less time searching and more time doing.</p>

				<p>Get inspired, get involved, and get into it!</p>

				<p>This website is a work in progress, if you would like to get involved, we meet weekly at ChiHackNight. You can learn more about ChiHackNight and register for the next event at <a href="https://chihacknight.org/" target="_blank">chihacknight.org</a></p>
